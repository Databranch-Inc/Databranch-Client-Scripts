# Remove-DuplicateItems

## Getting Started

This script will scan each folder of a given primary mailbox and personal archive (when
configured, Exchange 2010 and later) and removes duplicate items per folder. You can specify
how the items should be deleted and what items to process, e.g. mail items or appointments.
Sample scenarios are misbehaving 3rd party synchronization tool creates duplicate items or
(accidental) import of PST file with duplicate items.
